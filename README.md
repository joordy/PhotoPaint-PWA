# Progressive Web App

## üî¶ **Description**

In this course I'll learn how to create a Progressive Web Application from scratch. I use client-sideHTML, CSS and Vanilla JavaScript, together with a NodeJS server with the Express framework and express-handlebars templating language. With the usage of these languages, we create a complete application with offline-usages. The data is retrieved from a self-selected API and displayed inside the interface.

## üöÄ **Features**

### **Build scripts**

#### **Build**

```json
    "prebuild": "rimraf ./dist",
    "build": "npm-run-all build:static:css build:static:js build:assets",
    "build:static:css": "node scripts/build_css.js",
    "build:static:js": "webpack --config webpack.config.js",
    "build:assets": "node scripts/build_assets.js",
```

#### **Watch**

```json
    "watch": "run-p watch:*",
    "watch:js": "chokidar 'public/js/*.js' --command 'npm run build:static:js'",
    "watch:css": "chokidar 'public/css/*.css' && 'public/css/pages/*.css' --command 'npm run build:static:css'",
    "watch:assets": "chokidar 'public/**/*.*' --command 'npm run build:assets'"
```

#### **Dev**

```json
    "dev": "nodemon app.js",
```

### **Manifest & Service Worker**

### **Performance matters**

#### **Optimizing with picture source-sets**

To optimize all the images in my web application, I used the picture element of HTML, and added the lazy loading attribute. The advantage of this is that a suitable image is loaded at the correct resolution. For example, it is of little use to load a full-HD image for mobile, if the viewport is only 400px wide.

On the homepage, it had little effect, with a minimum gain of 50ms. However, it has had a lot of effect on the detail page, taking more than 1 full second off the ** load **, saving 5MB in terms of resources retrieved

```html
<picture>
  <source media="(min-width: 760px)" srcset="{{this.src.regular}}" />
  <source media="(min-width: 460px)" srcset="{{this.src.small}}" />
  <img src="{{this.src}}" alt="{{this.alt}}" id="" loading="lazy" />
</picture>
```

**Optimize detailpage image with picture sourceset**

#### **Optimizing page with gzip**

With the usage of the NPM package [compression](https://www.npmjs.com/package/compression) will it compress all the rendered files from the server. For example my CSS and JS bundles will be compressed and send to the client.

It gained small improvements on the home-page, but again a blazing fast render on the detail page.

```js
const compression = require('compression')

app.use(compression())
```

#### **Lighthouse audit optimizing result**

In the end I started to get my score in lighthouse as high as possible. By running different tests and adjusting the feedback given, the score has improved little by little to the below.

## üìà **Datasets**

For this project I made use of the Unsplash API for Developers. The API gives access to the world largest open collection of high quality photos, totally free. With using different querys, like searching, popular, etc etc, the user can receive a lot of information about the image. All the available information contains:

### Used endpoints

To make use of my application I've used two differend

- `https://api.unsplash.com/photos/?client_id=${API_KEY}&per_page=33&order_by=popular`
- `https://api.unsplash.com/search/photos/?client_id=${API_KEY}&query=${SEARCH_QUERY}&per_page=33&order_by=popular `
- `https://api.unsplash.com/photos/1gLdTsX3_70?client_id=${API_KEY}`

### API Response

After requesting the API you will receive an object with a lot of information about the photos. Below is described what all information means.
